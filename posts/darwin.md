every single thing that we do in this world, is for ourselves.
my only difference with others is that i'm self conscious about it.

but if the action is only serving his master, it won't last long.
in orther to make it stick in our genes and give it an evolutional value, we had to turn it into win-win games. i sacrifice for you so you'll sacrifice for me. i'll love you so you'll love me.

this would create stable relationships, societies and civilizations.

we can't afford to pay attention to this fact. because it somehow hurts and makes life less beautiful. the fact that even love of a mother to his child is just to stabalize her gene and guarantee its survival.

so what we do? create these win-win social games and after that simply brainwash ourselves to forget why they have been created in the first place. we tell ourselves fairy tales about love and other mind-opiums.
