# will
is there a free will? i would say yes. but it's domain and options are so limited that actually makes no free will. like a fish that is free to move wherever he wants - inside an aquarium.

it's like the choice in dark knight rises: death or exile. we are free to choose to die or work like hell to find a little peace, until we die.
