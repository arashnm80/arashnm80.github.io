# choice to be born
if i had any choice to be born whould i have chosen it?
absolutely not.

then why am i still here and struggling instead of leaving?
maybe it's the sunk cost fallacy.
maybe i'm too afraid to do it.
maybe i want to give a proper fight before my departure.
maybe i've got chained and addicted to this world.
maybe i'm fooling myself and i do want it.
maybe it's not me and it's the lack of dopamine that's talking.
