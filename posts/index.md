### c'est ma vie
paradise or hell, such is life; and either way in the end, this is my life. so what am i going to do with it and who do i choose to be now?
### all must choose
it's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me. every action is a choice and every choice is a sacrifice; sacrifice of what could have been in all the other countless universes where i choose the other options and face the other possiblities. that's the newton's third law, in order to get somewhere, we have to leave sth behind. we have to prioritize one thing over the others. there is never enough time/energy/resources for trying/perfecting everything and we have to choose wisely. big people make big choices and those who can't sacrifice anything, will earn nothing.
### play to win or don't play at all
each week that i'm still breathing, means that i'm not choosing death over life yet. there is no middle ground and when you play, you don't play by half measures. leave; or stay and battle for narrow possiblity to live.
### no time for caution
a minute or a century more in this world, niksen or working like hell, do it in way that you'd be willing to do it all over again.
