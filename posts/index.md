### c'est ma vie
paradise or hell, such is life. and either way in the end, this is my life. so what am i going to do with it and who do i choose to be now?
### play to win or don't play at all
every week that i'm staying here, means i'm not choosing death yet. so leave or stay and battle for narrow possiblity to live.
### no time for caution
no matter of staying one more minute or one more century, do it in a way that you'd be able to say "i'll do it all over again". peaceful niksen time is not wasted time but time spent on anti-values is.
### all must choose
