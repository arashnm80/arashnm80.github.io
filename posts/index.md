## c'est ma vie
paradise or hell, such is life; and either way in the end, this is my life.
i'm solely responsible for my life.
i am the highest priority and main product of my life.
there is no savior, i'm the person that has to be the savior of mine.
so what am i going to do with it and who do i choose to be now?

## all must choose
it's not who i am underneath, but what i do that defines me. every action is a choice and every choice is a sacrifice; sacrifice of what could have been in all the other countless universes where i could have chosen the other options and faced the other possiblities. that's the newton's third law, in order to get somewhere, we have to leave sth behind. we have to prioritize one thing over the others. there is never enough time/energy/resources for trying/perfecting everything and we have to choose wisely. big people make big choices and those who can't sacrifice anything, will earn nothing.

## play to win or don't play at all
every [week](/weeks) that i'm still breathing, means that i'm not choosing death over life yet. there is no middle ground. when you play, you don't play by half measures. so LEAVE; or stay and battle for narrow possiblity to LIVE.

## no time for caution
the most climactic moment of my life, is right now. not as a good sounding quote, but as a primal truth to believe inside my bloods. if i'm at the highest point of my graph, it can be by me not getting arrogant and complacent. and if i'm at the lowest state and rock bottom of my life, it can be by not forgetting my values and choosing to start again.
whether i stay one more minute or one more century in this world, whether i'm doing nothing and enjoying the peace of niksen or i'm working like hell to end the wars, i'm gonna do it in way that i'd be willing to do it all over again.

## don't make the same mistake twice
experience isn't the total time passed
