## c'est ma vie
paradise or hell, such is life; and either way in the end, this is my life.
there is no savior, i should be the one who saves me.
i'm the only one responsible for my life.
i am the highest priority, main character and main product of my life.
so what am i going to do with it and who do i choose to be now?

## play to win or don't play at all
each [week](/weeks) that i'm still breathing, means that i'm not choosing to leave yet. if i'm sacrificing and postponing my death one more week, it should be for a life worth living. i have to choose and then fully commit. there is no middle ground, when you play you don't play by half measures. so leave; or drive it like you stole it.

## no time for caution
the most climactic moment of my life, is right now. not as a good sounding quote, but as a primal truth running in my veins. if i'm at the peak of me, it can be by not getting arrogant and complacent. and if i'm at the nadir and rock bottom of my life, it can be by not forgetting my values and choosing to start over again.
whether i stay one more minute or one more century in this world, whether i'm doing nothing and enjoying the peace of niksen or i'm working like hell and fighting in wars, i'm gonna do it in way that i'd be willing to do it all over again.
