## c'est ma vie
paradise or hell, such is life; and either way in the end, this is my life.
i'm the only one responsible for my life. there is no savior, i should be the one who saves me.
i am the highest priority, main character and main product of my life.
**so what am i going to do with it and who do i choose to be now?**

## play to win or don't play at all
[each week](/weeks) that i'm still breathing, means that i haven't chosen to leave yet. if i'm sacrificing my death and postponing it one more week, it should be for a life worth living. there is no middle ground, when i play i can't play by half measures. i have to choose and then fully commit. **so leave it; or drive it like you stole it.**

## no time for caution
the most important moment of my life, is right now. whether i stay one more minute or one more century in this world, whether enjoying the peace of niksen or enduring the pain of fighting in wars, **i'm gonna do it in way that i'd be willing to do it all over again.**
