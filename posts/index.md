### c'est ma vie
paradise or hell, such is life; and either way in the end, this is my life. so what am i going to do with it and who do i choose to be now?
### all must choose
desires do not matter, only actions. every action is a choice and every choice is a sacrifice - sacrifice of what could have been in all the other possibilities. that's newton's third law, in order to get somewhere, we have to leave sth behind. we have to prioritize one thing over infinite other things. there is never enough time, energy and resources for all of the possiblities.
### play to win or don't play at all
each week that i'm still breathing, means i'm not choosing death over life yet. and you don't play by half measures. leave; or stay and battle for narrow possiblity to live.
### no time for caution
a minute or a century more in this world, niksen or working like hell, do it in way that you'd be willing to do it all over again.
