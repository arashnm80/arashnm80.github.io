## c'est ma vie
paradise or hell, such is life, and either way in the end, this is my life.
i am the highest priority, main character and main product of my life.
there is no savior, i'm the the one who can save me.
i'm the only one responsible for my life.
**so what am i going to do with it and who do i choose to be now?**

## play to win or don't play at all
**[each week](/weeks)** that i'm still breathing, means that i haven't chosen to leave yet. if i'm sacrificing my death and postponing it one more week, i want it to be for a life worth living. i'm thrown into this game but i can't play by half measures, i need to go all in. there is no middle ground, i have to choose and then fully commit. **i should leave it, or drive it like i stole it.**

## no time for caution
the most important moment of my life, is right now. whether i leave in a minute or stay for a lifetime, whether i spend it in niksen or warmongering, **i'm gonna do it [in a way](/zen) that i'd be willing to do it all over again.**
