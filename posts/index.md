### c'est ma vie
paradise or hell, such is life; and either way in the end, this is my life. so what am i going to do with it and who do i choose to be now?
### all must choose
intent does not matter, only actions and consequences. every action is a choice. every choice is a sacrifice in its nature. that's newton's third law, in order to get somewhere, we have to leave sth behind. we have to prioritize one thing over another.
### play to win or don't play at all
every week that i'm breathing, means i'm not choosing death yet. so leave or stay and battle for narrow possiblity to live.
### no time for caution
a minute or a century, do it in way that you'd be willing to do it all over again. peaceful niksen time is not wasted time but time spent on anti-values is.
