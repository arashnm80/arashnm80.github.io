## c'est ma vie
paradise or hell, such is life; and either way in the end, this is my life.
i am the highest priority, main character and main product of my life.
there is no savior, i should be the one who saves me.
i'm the only one responsible for my life.
so what am i going to do with it and who do i choose to be now?

## all must choose
it's not who i am underneath, but what i do that defines me. every action is a choice and every choice is a sacrifice; sacrifice of what could have been in all other possible parallel universes where i make the different options. that's the newton's third law, in order to get somewhere, we have to leave sth behind. we have to prioritize one thing over infinite others. there is never enough time/energy/resources for trying/perfecting everything and i have to choose wisely to minimize my accumulated regret. big people make big choices and those who can't sacrifice anything, will earn nothing.

## play to win or don't play at all
each [week](/weeks) that i'm still breathing, means that i'm not choosing to leave yet. if i'm sacrificing my death one more week, it should be for a life worth living. there is no middle ground, when you play you don't play by half measures. so leave; or stay and battle for narrow possiblity to live.

## no time for caution
the most climactic moment of my life, is right now. not as a good sounding quote, but as a primal truth running in my veins. if i'm at the peak of me, it can be by not getting arrogant and complacent. and if i'm at the nadir and rock bottom of my life, it can be by not forgetting my values and choosing to start again.
whether i stay one more minute or one more century in this world, whether i'm doing nothing and enjoying the peace of niksen or i'm working like hell and fighting in wars, i'm gonna do it in way that i'd be willing to do it all over again.

## don't make the same mistake twice
experience isn't the amount of times i've been around the sun. it's change. it's learning the patterns and rewriting my neurons. it's walking out of my comfort zone in order to discover more.
