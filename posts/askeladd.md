> A man, slave to gold, holds a whip... And beats the slave he bought with that gold as if to claim HE is the master. He just doesn't see it for himself. Every living human being is a slave to something.

> You're young. Time is on your side. You'll grow up and I'll grow old. Someday you'll likely beat me. It's only natural. Even the strongest man must die.

> On the battlefield, the weak die first. Like you.

> the fool loses because he is a fool.

> Don't hang on... To this petty bullshit your entire life... You've got to move on... go further...move on, Thorfinn.
