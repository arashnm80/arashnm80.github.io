some ideas that i think help the overall result of our work-life balance. the list is subject to change and some of them might contradict with each other. they are just different tactics and everyone should choose his own suitable tactics. sometimes you can win by playing attacking and sometimes by being defensive. also i'm not an expert in them. i'm even so terrible in some of them. but they are the tips i believe can improve our performance in life. effect of each one might be very small and down to 0.01% or 0.001%, but with applying enough of them, some meaningful numbers will appear.

### good sleep
take care of your body. maybe this world doesn't suck that much and all you need is an honest night of sleep.
### non zero week / streak
it doesn't matter what is the maximum amount of time/energy you can spend for a goal. what really matters is to not letting the minimum of it to reach zero in any week. even when you're sick or tired or depressed or super busy, take a tiny baby step toward that goal. if it's not possible, means you should lower the number of goals you're focusing on or means that you're not giving yourself enough hobbies and joys to get recharged again.
### gall law
you can't create a complex system like homo sapien all of a sudden out of nowhere. you gotta start with a single cell and evolve it bit by bit over time. the same is true for a company, application or any other complex system.
### chill
you can't push yourself to the end of your body limits every day. it doesn't work in long term and you'll eventually burn out. you gotta listen to your body. give it time. attack each task when it's right time for both of you.
# separate work with checking social media
for a deep work and staying in the zone, don't check the phone during work. set up certain boundaries.
