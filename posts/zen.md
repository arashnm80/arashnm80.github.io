# zen

## face it
accept the reality.
accept that this is my life and i'm the only one responsible for it.
accept who i am.
accept where i don't have a choice or free will.
accept what i have to do.
acknowledge myself.
acknowledge my body.
acknowledge my feelings and desires.
acknowledge my powers.
acknowledge my limitations, fears, mistakes and failures.
acknowledge where i do have options and free will.

## choose & commit
choose what i want from the life, and then go all in for it.
there is no middle ground.
play to win or don't play at all.
either choose to take this life and do my best for a decent living.
or choose to leave it and do my best for a peaceful departure.

## no time for caution
choose to be in a way that i'd be willing to come back to this moment and be this all over again.

## pain
pain is the reason we push forward.
choose the type of pain i want.
