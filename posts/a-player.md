As I type this, I realize it may not be the wisest to categorize everyone into 3 buckets, but this is how I believe we should look at everyone who is part of the production team. You’re either an A-Player, B-Player, or C-Player.

There is only room in this company for A-Players.
A-Players are obsessive, learn from mistakes, coachable, intelligent, don’t make excuses, believe in YouTube, see the value of this company, and are the best in the goddamn world at their job.

B-Players are new people that need to be trained into A-Players.

C-Players are just average employees. They don’t suck, but they aren’t exceptional at what they do. They just exist, do whatever, and get a paycheck. They aren’t obsessive and learning. C-Players are poisonous and should be transitioned to a different company IMMEDIATELY. (It’s okay, we give everyone severance — they’ll be fine.)
