# zoom out
is the main question,

how to make this line of code work?
or how to make this function work?
or how to make this application work?
or how to satisfy a big number of users?
or how to generate a big revenue?
or how to create a happy life?

there are many times that we are under the influence of pressure/stress/anger/depression/lack of dopamine/sadness/anxiety and we tend to get lost in the chaos of details. we forget what has been our main goal/motivation/idea/plan/situation/principle and why have we started some course of action in the first place.

we need to zoom out, see the bigger picture and ask the right question.
each time we go one step back, we are able to see more alternative paths for the previous question and sometimes we even find out we have been asking the wrong questions.
