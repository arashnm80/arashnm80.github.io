# zoom out
is the main question,

how to make this line of code work?
or how to make this function work?
or how to make this application work?
or how to satisfy a big number of users?
or how to generate a big revenue?
or how to create a happy life?

there are many times that we are under the influence of pressure/stress/anger/depression/lack of dopamine/sadness/anxiety and we tend to get lost in the chaos of details. we forget what has been our main goal/motivation/idea/plan/situation/principle and why have we started this course of action in the first place.

in order to ask the right question we need to zoom out, think out of the box and see the bigger picture.
each time we go one step backwards, we are able to see more alternative paths and sometimes we even find out we have been asking the wrong questions.
