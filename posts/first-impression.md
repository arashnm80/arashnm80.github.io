# first impression
it's much easier to found things correct and maintain it that way, than to found it wrong and try to change it in future.

in work it's important to hire the right person in the beginning.
in school it's important to treat students with right attitude in the beginning.

if the right culture doesn't being created in the first place, it would be too damn hard to to change it later.
