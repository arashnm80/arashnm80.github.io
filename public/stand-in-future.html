<p dir="auto" dir="auto">build things that might not be useful because of technology or culture or other requirements but you know there will be some point in future that they will finally be feasible and adopted.</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">in case of ai, its math has been around for many years but we didn't have the tech to do the computations. so we just had to wait all this time.</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">the same applies to unreal engine. <a dir="auto" href="https://<a dir="auto" href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc</a>">tim sweeney</a> says that they knew how to do it long ago. but it took 1.5 seconds for every frame to render (which was too slow). so they had to wait for the technologies and hardwares to reach the level of thier usages.</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">i think i should ask myself what kind of products i can start building today and finish/publish later at some point when the world is ready? instead of chasing trends, i should ask myself where can i stand that a trend comes to me at some point?</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">the point is to be the <em>first mover</em> at some possible futures.</p>
