<p dir="auto" dir="auto">A man, slave to gold, holds a whip... And beats the slave he bought with that gold as if to claim HE is the master. He just doesn't see it for himself. Every living human being is a slave to something.</p>
<p dir="auto" dir="auto">You're young. Time is on your side. You'll grow up and I'll grow old. Someday you'll likely beat me. It's only natural. Even the strongest man must die.</p>
<p dir="auto" dir="auto">On the battlefield, the weak die first. Like you.</p>
<p dir="auto" dir="auto">the fool loses because he is a fool.</p>
<p dir="auto" dir="auto">Don't hang on... To this petty bullshit your entire life... You've got to move on... go further...move on, Thorfinn.</p>
