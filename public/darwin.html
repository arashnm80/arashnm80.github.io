    <h1 dir="auto" id="darwin">darwin</h1>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">every single thing that we do in this world, is for ourselves.<br />
my only difference with others is that i'm self conscious about it.</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">but if the action is only serving his master, it won't last long.<br />
in orther to make it stick in our genes and give it an evolutional value, we had to turn it into win-win games. i sacrifice for you so you'll sacrifice for me. i'll love you so you'll love me.</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">this would create stable relationships, societies and civilizations.</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">we can't afford to pay attention to this fact. because it somehow hurts and makes life less beautiful. the fact that even love of a mother to his child is just to stabalize her gene and guarantee its survival.</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">so what we do? create these win-win social games and after that simply brainwash ourselves to forget why they have been created in the first place. we tell ourselves fairy tales about love and other mind-opiums.</p>
