<p dir="auto" dir="auto">it's much easier to found things correct and maintain it that way, than to found it wrong and try to change it in future.</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">in work it's important to hire the right person in the beginning.<br />
in school it's important to treat students with right attitude in the beginning.</p>

<p dir="auto" dir="auto">if the right culture doesn't being created in the first place, it would be too damn hard to to change it later.</p>
