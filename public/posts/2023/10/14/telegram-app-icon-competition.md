## The Task

Each of your app icons must be based on the core form of the [Telegram logo](https://telegram.org/tour/screenshots#logos). You are free to incorporate any scenes or characters, **except** copyrighted materials. 

Using Telegram's official sticker and emoji packs is **allowed** for references (you can adapt characters to create icons based on them). The use of generative AI is **strictly prohibited**.
