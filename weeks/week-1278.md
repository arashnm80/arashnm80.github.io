i guess sadness, loneliness and depression are the fabric of life and our very essence. there is no running away from them. there is no ignoring or erasing them. we're practically living in an ocean of these pains, and no one can drain an ocean. but still, that doesn't mean we can't learn to swim. while most of our body is in the water, we can still try to keep our head above surface and breathe. sure there will be some water down our throat once in a while no matter of how good a swimmer we are. sure it takes a lot of energy and it's hell of a struggle every day. they're inevitable. but as long as there is hope for reaching sth worthwhile in the surface, it might be possible; to fight.
